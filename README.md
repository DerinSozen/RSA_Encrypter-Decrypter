# RSA Encoder/Decoder

This is a personal project to demonstrate my knowledge of Discrete math from CS173 and personal passions in encryption and modular arithmetic Theory

It accepts a message and a passphrase, using the passphrase to encrypt the message

Prime numbers are generated using the Sieve Of Eratosthenes algorithm

## Usage

```C++
./main
```
 When calling, make sure to either specify encryption or decryption with the flags "--encrypt" or "--decrypt"

This program is only designed to handle argument and will not work with other use cases

**Examples:**
```C++
./main --encrypt
```
```C++
./main --decrypt
```
